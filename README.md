# ðŸ§  Malnutrition Classification System

A full-stack deep learning system for classifying child malnutrition using facial images. Built using TensorFlow, FastAPI, Streamlit, and Docker, this pipeline enables fast, scalable, and interpretable predictions. Designed for health workers, humanitarian responders, and public health systems, particularly in under-resourced regions.

## Why Malnutrition?

Malnutrition is a leading cause of child mortality in **Sub-Saharan Africa**, contributing to approximately **45% of all deaths among children under five** (UNICEF). It affects physical growth, cognitive development, immunity, and increases the risk of disease. Early detection is essential â€” but many regions lack access to trained personnel or diagnostic tools.

This project aims to provide a **low-cost, automated solution** to detect malnutrition from child images, empowering frontline health workers and improving screening efforts where theyâ€™re most needed.
